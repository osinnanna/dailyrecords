Most times projects don't really need a problem statement but for this one here it is.

## Problem

I'll explain the situation. In my mom's salon which she owns, If y'know what they use to do bookkeeping -> (3 different Hardcover books and these things are massive I'll just give an estimate of just over 300leaves each.). Then in the evenings or other days she'd just spend a while at her side with an office calculator not those ones that students in school. For example, Texas intruments or even casio but those ones with the bare minimum for bookkeeping.

## The Solution

The idea is to start small from very tiny and dumb ingestion like this just an entry and a price then it gets built more and more. even auto calculations and everything. I want to then run everyhting on a simple raspberry pi 4 which would be pressent in the workplace. The idea was for a mobile app but considering my mom uses an apple device and theres also android deveices and one office computer which is windows around that brings in the most useless complexity every, not even getting to actaully doing things like apple developer account of playstore thats why a served web application is the way that has been chosen. Bun is the way to go as it will be compiled into a binary.)
